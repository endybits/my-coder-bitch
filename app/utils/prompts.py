}
Additional considerations:
- The code generated should be valid and executable
- The code should be as simple and clean as possible
- The code should be as efficient as possible
- The variable is_there_code should be true if the assistant was able to generate a valid code, otherwise false
- The coder_assistan_answer should be a natural language response, coherent with the code generated if any; otherwise, it should ask for more details.
- The assistant should be able to handle different types of problems or requirements
